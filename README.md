# I. ABSTRACT 
## The Jacobian Matrix is a mathematical tool that acts like a translator between the joint velocities and end-effector velocities of a robot manipulator. The Jacobian Matrix plays a vital role in analyzing the motion of a Cylindrical Manipulator. Cylindrical Manipulator is a robot with 3 degrees of freedom (DOF): one revolute joint for rotation around the axis, and two prismatic joints for linear extension along orthogonal axes.
