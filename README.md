# I. ABSTRACT 
### The Jacobian Matrix is a mathematical tool that acts like a translator between the joint velocities and end-effector velocities of a robot manipulator. The Jacobian Matrix plays a vital role in analyzing the motion of a Cylindrical Manipulator. Cylindrical Manipulator is a robot with 3 degrees of freedom (DOF): one revolute joint for rotation around the axis, and two prismatic joints for linear extension along orthogonal axes.
### The Jacobian Matrix Stucture for a Cylindrical Manipulator will have dimensions of 3x3, reflecting the three DOF of the end-effector (linear motion in X, Y, and Z). The first column will correspond to the revolute joint, influencing the end-effector's rotational velocity around the Z-axis and potentionally affecting its Y position depending on the current condiguration. The remaining two columns will represent the contributions of the prismatic joints to the linear velocities in X and Y directions. When it comes to Singularity Analysis, the Jacobian Matrix can become singular at specific configurations of the manipulator. This indicates a loss of dexterity, where certain end-effector motions can be achieved regardless a joint velocities. Analyzing the Jacobian helps identify these singular configurations and avoid them during robot operation. In Velocity Mapping, the Jacobian allows us to map the desired end-effector velocities (linear and rotational) to the required joint velocities for each joint manipulator. This is crucial for robot control and trajectory planning.

# II. INTRODUCTION 
### In robotics, precise control over a robot's movements is crucial for successful task completion. Two key concepts play a vital role in achieving this control: the Jacobian Matrix and Path & Trajectory Planning. Cylindrical manipulator, with their unique three-dimensional reach, are widely used in various industrial applications. Precise control over their movements is essential for successful task execution. This introduction explores the Jacobian Matric and its significance in Path and Trajectory Planning for these manipulator.
### The Jacobian Matrix for Cylindrical Manipulator plays a vital role in translating joint velocities into end-effector velocities for cylindrical manipulator. It's a 3x3 matrix where the two rows represent the three possible motions of the end-effector (linear X, Y, and Z). The columns represent the velocities of the three joints (theta, X and Y). Each element in the matrix reflects how a specific joint's velocity contributes to a particular component of the end-effector's motion. The Jacobian helps us understand how the rotational movement (theta) of the revolute joint affects Z-axis rotation and potentially Y position (depending on the current arm configuration) and the linear extensions (X and Y) of the prismatic joints influence the end-effector's motion along the corresponding X and Y axes.
### Path and Trajectory Planning work together to define the robot's desired movements. The Path Planning focuses on the broad outline of the robot's movement, defining the start and goal positions of the end-effector while avoiding obstacles in the environment. It's like planning the general route on a map. The Trajectory Planning takes the path defined in the previous step and determines the specific timing and movement details for the robot to follow along that path. It's like specifying the speed, acceleration, and precise movements for each joint to navigate the route smoothly. Path planning defines the desired waypoints for the end-effector to reach the goal location, avoiding obstacles. Trajectory planning specifies the detailed motion profile, including the exact path the end-effector follows between waypoints and the timing (speed and acceleration) for each joint movement along the path.
### The Jacobian matrix serves as a bridge between the high-level path definition and the low-level joint controls for cylindrical manipulators. By leveraging the Jacobian in path and trajectory planning, we can achieve precise and efficient motion control for these robots, enabling them to perform tasks effectively in various industrial settings.
